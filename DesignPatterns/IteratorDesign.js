//You are correct again! This code snippet is indeed a clear and well-implemented example of the Iterator Design Pattern.

//It allows you to traverse through a collection (items) sequentially without exposing its underlying structure (like whether it's an array, linked list, etc.).

const items=[1,'sami',3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];

function Iterator(items){
    this.items=items;
    this.index=0; // where we start in the collection
}

// it is for front to back .. we can also implement back to front only change the index logic
/*Memory Efficiency:

If you defined hasNext and next directly inside the Iterator constructor function (e.g., this.hasNext = function(){...}), every time you create a new Iterator instance, a new copy of those functions would be created.

By attaching them to Iterator.prototype, there's only one copy of hasNext and next in memory, which is shared by all Iterator instances. This saves memory, especially if you create many iterators.*/
Iterator.prototype={
    hasNext:function(){
        return this.index<this.items.length;
    },
    next:function(){
        return this.items[this.index++];
    }
}

const iterator=new Iterator(items);

console.log('Iterating over items:');

while(iterator.hasNext()){
    console.log(iterator.next());
}
